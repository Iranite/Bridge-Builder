# Bridge-Builder
A Mod for Fortresscraft Evolved!

		Automatically builds long, straight bridges. Best used in Sky Island or Skyblock worlds!
		While this machine has a built in paste grinder, it can only produce one type of block (paintable).
		To create a bridge block, 4 garbage blocks have to be supplied in an adjacent hopper.
		Power usage goes up when the bridge gets longer.
		Required research: Aesthetics and Assembly Line Machines.
		Press E to start or stop the machine
		Q and T decrease or increase the build limit.
		The Bridge Builder will build until it finds the other side, or the set build limit was reached.
